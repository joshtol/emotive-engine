### Title

`[Project] Emotive Engine - Musical time-synchronized animation engine for AI interfaces`

### Body

````markdown
Hey r/javascript! I've been working on an open-source animation engine
specifically designed for AI-powered interfaces, and I'm excited to share it
with you all.

## What is Emotive Engine?

Emotive Engine is a Canvas 2D animation library that creates expressive,
particle-based character animations. What makes it unique is the **musical time
synchronization** system.

## The Problem It Solves

Traditional animation libraries work in milliseconds:

```js
setTimeout(() => bounce(), 500); // Works at 120 BPM, breaks at 90 BPM
```
````

When your animation needs to sync with music or maintain rhythm across different
tempos, hardcoded timings drift out of sync.

## The Solution

Emotive Engine uses **beats** as the atomic unit:

```js
mascot.express('bounce'); // Automatically 667ms at 90 BPM, 500ms at 120 BPM
```

Change the tempo, everything adjusts. No recalculation needed.

## Key Features

- 🎨 **15 Emotional States** - joy, calm, excited, sadness, love, focused,
  anger, fear, surprise, etc.
- 🎵 **Musical Time Sync** - Animations adapt to any BPM automatically
- 🎭 **44 Semantic Performances** - Context-aware choreography (celebrating,
  welcoming, empathizing)
- ⚡ **High Performance** - 60 FPS on mobile with adaptive quality
- 🔧 **TypeScript Ready** - Full type definitions included
- 📦 **Zero Dependencies** - Pure Canvas 2D, no WebGL required

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install @joshtol/emotive-engine
```

```javascript
import EmotiveMascot from '@joshtol/emotive-engine';

const canvas = document.getElementById('mascot-canvas');
const mascot = new EmotiveMascot({
    canvasId: 'mascot-canvas',
    targetFPS: 60,
});

await mascot.init(canvas);
mascot.start();

// Try these commands
mascot.setEmotion('calm');
mascot.morphTo('heart');
mascot.express('pulse');
```

### Title
`I built an animation engine that syncs to musical time instead of clock time [Open Source]`

### Body
```markdown
After building several AI interfaces that needed expressive animations, I kept running into the same problem: **hardcoded animation timings break when tempo changes**.

So I built Emotive Engine - an open-source Canvas 2D animation library that uses **musical time** as the atomic unit.

## The Problem

```js
// Traditional approach
setTimeout(() => bounce(), 500);  // Perfect at 120 BPM
// Switch to 90 BPM song? Now 500ms = 0.75 beats. Everything drifts.
````

## The Solution

```js
// Emotive Engine approach
mascot.express('bounce'); // Automatically 667ms at 90 BPM, 500ms at 120 BPM
```

Specify animations in beats, not milliseconds. Change tempo, everything adapts.

## What It Does

- **Particle-based character animations** with emotional states (joy, calm,
  anger, etc.)
- **Shape morphing** (circle → heart → star with smooth transitions)
- **Beat detection** from audio input
- **Semantic performances** (celebrating, empathizing, welcoming)
- **60 FPS on mobile** with adaptive quality

## Tech Stack

- Pure Canvas 2D (no WebGL)
- Zero runtime dependencies
- TypeScript definitions included
- 238KB gzipped bundle

## Live Demos

- Interactive playground: https://emotiveengine.com/demo
- Real-world use cases: https://emotiveengine.com
- Example code: https://github.com/joshtol/emotive-engine/tree/main/examples

## Install

```bash
npm install @joshtol/emotive-engine
```

Would love feedback from the community! Built this solving real problems in AI
UX, curious if others have similar needs.

# Building an Animation Engine for AI Interfaces: Why Musical Time Matters

After building several AI-powered interfaces with emotional avatars, I kept encountering a fundamental problem: **animations that worked perfectly at one tempo completely fell apart when the music changed.**

This led me to build [Emotive Engine](https://github.com/joshtol/emotive-engine) - an open-source animation library that thinks in **beats**, not **milliseconds**.

## The Problem: Clock Time vs Musical Time

Most animation libraries work like this:

```javascript
// Bounce animation hardcoded to 500ms
setTimeout(() => bounce(), 500);
````

At 120 BPM, 500ms = exactly 1 beat. Perfect!

But switch to a 90 BPM song? Now 500ms = 0.75 beats. Everything drifts
off-rhythm because the animation doesn't know about tempo.

## The Solution: Musical Time as First-Class Citizen

What if animations were specified in **beats** instead of **milliseconds**?

```javascript
// Bounce animation specified as 1 beat
mascot.express('bounce'); // Duration adapts to current BPM
```

A "1 beat" bounce automatically becomes:

- 500ms at 120 BPM
- 667ms at 90 BPM
- 353ms at 170 BPM

Change the tempo, everything adjusts. No recalculation needed.

## Real-World Use Cases

I built Emotive Engine while working on several AI interface projects:

### 1. Cherokee Language Learning

An emotionally-responsive AI tutor that celebrates correct answers and
empathizes with mistakes. The mascot's expressions needed to feel natural while
syncing to background music for cultural immersion.

**Live demo**: https://emotiveengine.com/use-cases/cherokee

### 2. E-commerce AI Assistant

A shopping bot that gets excited when you add items to cart, but needed
animations timed to the store's background music without recoding for every
playlist.

**Live demo**: https://emotiveengine.com/use-cases/retail

### 3. Smart Home Voice Assistant

A visual avatar for Alexa/Google Home that pulses with voice commands and dances
to music playback, all perfectly synchronized.

**Live demo**: https://emotiveengine.com/use-cases/smart-home

## Technical Architecture

### Core Systems

**1. Musical Time Manager** Converts between beats and milliseconds based on
current BPM:

```javascript
class MusicalTimeManager {
    setBPM(bpm) {
        this.bpm = bpm;
        this.beatDuration = (60 / bpm) * 1000; // ms per beat
    }

    beatsToMs(beats) {
        return beats * this.beatDuration;
    }
}
```

**2. Emotional State Machine** 15 emotional states with smooth transitions:

```javascript
mascot.setEmotion('joy'); // Bright colors, upward motion
mascot.setEmotion('calm'); // Cool tones, slow breathing
mascot.setEmotion('excited'); // Rapid particles, energetic
```

**3. Particle Behavior System** 200-500 particles with emotion-driven physics:

```javascript
class ParticleBehavior {
    update(particle, emotion, deltaTime) {
        // Adjust velocity, color, size based on emotional state
        particle.velocity.y += emotion.gravityModifier;
        particle.color = lerpColor(particle.color, emotion.targetColor);
    }
}
```

**4. Gesture Choreography** 44 built-in semantic performances:

```javascript
mascot.perform('celebrating'); // Executes multi-step choreography
// 1. Morph to star shape
// 2. Express excitement
// 3. Spin gesture
// 4. Sparkle particles
```

## Performance Optimizations

### Adaptive Quality System

```javascript
class AdaptiveQuality {
    adjustForDevice() {
        const isMobile = /mobile/i.test(navigator.userAgent);
        this.particleCount = isMobile ? 150 : 400;
        this.targetFPS = 60;
    }

    monitorFrameRate() {
        if (this.avgFPS < 55) {
            this.particleCount *= 0.8; // Reduce by 20%
        }
    }
}
```

**Results**:

- **Desktop**: 60 FPS with 400 particles
- **Mobile**: 60 FPS with 150 particles
- **Bundle**: 238KB gzipped

### Canvas 2D vs WebGL

I chose Canvas 2D over WebGL because:

1. **Simpler**: No shader compilation overhead
2. **Universal**: Better mobile browser support
3. **Sufficient**: 500 particles at 60 FPS is plenty for UI elements
4. **Smaller**: No WebGL library dependencies

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm install @joshtol/emotive-engine
```

### Basic Usage

```javascript
import EmotiveMascot from '@joshtol/emotive-engine';

// Get canvas element
const canvas = document.getElementById('mascot-canvas');

// Create mascot instance
const mascot = new EmotiveMascot({
    canvasId: 'mascot-canvas',
    targetFPS: 60,
    defaultEmotion: 'neutral',
    initialBPM: 120,
});

// Initialize with canvas
await mascot.init(canvas);
mascot.start();

// Control emotions and gestures
mascot.setEmotion('joy');
mascot.morphTo('heart');
mascot.express('bounce');

// Change tempo - animations adapt automatically
mascot.setBPM(90);
```

### Audio Integration

```javascript
// Connect to audio for beat detection
const audioContext = new AudioContext();
const analyser = audioContext.createAnalyser();

mascot.connectAudio(analyser);
mascot.enableBeatDetection(true);

// Mascot now pulses with detected beats
```

## Example: Building a Breathing App

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Breathing Exercise</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <canvas id="mascot-canvas" width="400" height="400"></canvas>

        <script type="module">
            import EmotiveMascot from '@joshtol/emotive-engine';

            const canvas = document.getElementById('mascot-canvas');
            const mascot = new EmotiveMascot({
                canvasId: 'mascot-canvas',
                defaultEmotion: 'calm',
                initialBPM: 60, // 60 BPM = 1 breath per second
            });

            await mascot.init(canvas);
            mascot.start();

            // Breathing cycle: 4 seconds in, 4 seconds out
            function breathingCycle() {
                mascot.express('expand'); // 4 beats = 4 seconds at 60 BPM
                setTimeout(() => {
                    mascot.express('contract'); // 4 beats
                }, 4000);
            }

            breathingCycle();
            setInterval(breathingCycle, 8000);
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```

### Roadmap

Current priorities:

- [ ] React wrapper component
- [ ] Plugin system for custom emotions
- [ ] Additional shape morphs
- [ ] WebGL renderer option
- [ ] More semantic performances

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Musical Time Is Fundamental

Once you start thinking in beats instead of milliseconds, everything gets
simpler. The animation code doesn't need to know about tempo changes - the time
manager handles it.

### 2. Adaptive Quality > Fixed Quality

Different devices have wildly different capabilities. Monitoring frame rate and
adjusting particle count dynamically keeps performance smooth everywhere.

### 3. Semantic APIs > Low-Level APIs

`mascot.perform('celebrating')` is more intuitive than manually choreographing 4
separate animations.

### 4. Canvas 2D Is Underrated

Everyone jumps to WebGL, but Canvas 2D is perfectly capable for UI-scale
particle systems and has better compatibility.

Author here. I built Emotive Engine while working on AI interfaces that needed expressive animations synced to music.

The core insight: most animation libraries work in milliseconds, but music works in beats. When tempo changes, hardcoded timings drift.

Emotive Engine uses beats as the atomic unit. Specify "bounce for 1 beat" and it automatically becomes:
- 500ms at 120 BPM
- 667ms at 90 BPM
- 353ms at 170 BPM

- Musical time manager (beats ↔ ms conversion)
- Particle behavior system (200-500 particles)
- Emotional state machine (15 states)
- Semantic choreography (44 performances)
- Adaptive quality (monitors FPS, adjusts particle count)

Happy to answer technical questions about the implementation!
