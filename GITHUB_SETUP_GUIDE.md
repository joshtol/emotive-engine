- Format: **Open-ended discussion**

#### Create Example Discussions

Create these 4 example discussions to show users the format:

**1. Q&A Example**

Category: **Q&A** Title: `How do I sync animations to a custom BPM?` Body:

````markdown
I'm building a music visualizer and want to sync the mascot's animations to a
specific BPM from my audio analysis.

**What I've tried:**

```javascript
const mascot = new EmotiveMascot({ canvasId: 'canvas' });
mascot.setBPM(120); // This sets the BPM
```

**Question:** How do I dynamically update the BPM based on real-time beat
detection?

**Environment:**

- Emotive Engine: v2.5.1
- Framework: React 18
````

Then **reply to yourself** with:

````markdown
Great question! You can update the BPM dynamically using `setBPM()` in your beat
detection callback:

```javascript
// Assuming you have a beat detector
beatDetector.onBeatDetected(detectedBPM => {
    mascot.setBPM(detectedBPM);
});

// Or update periodically
setInterval(() => {
    const currentBPM = analyzeBPM(audioContext);
    mascot.setBPM(currentBPM);
}, 1000); // Update every second
```

The mascot will automatically adjust all animation timings to match the new BPM!

Check out the
[audio integration example](https://github.com/joshtol/emotive-engine/tree/main/examples)
for more details.

**2. Show and Tell Example**

Category: **Show and Tell** Title:
`Cherokee Language Flashcard App with Emotional Animations` Body:

````markdown
I built an interactive Cherokee language learning app that uses Emotive Engine
to bring each phrase to life!

**Live Demo:** https://emotiveengine.com/use-cases/cherokee

## What It Does

- üìö Displays Cherokee greetings with pronunciation and cultural context
- üé® Each phrase triggers unique emotions and gestures
- üåô Shape morphing (sun for morning, moon for night greetings)
- üéµ Musical timing for smooth animation sequences
- üì± Fully responsive with touch swipe navigation

## Example: "Thank you" (·è©·èô)

```javascript
{
  cherokee: '·è©·èô',
  pronunciation: 'wah-doh',
  emotion: 'love',
  intensity: 1.0,
  gestures: [
    {name: 'glow', delay: 300},
    {name: 'pulse', delay: 500}
  ]
}
```

## Tech Stack

- Emotive Engine v2.5.1
- React + Next.js
- Cherokee syllabary (·è£·é≥·é© ·éß·è¨·èÇ·éØ·èç·èó)

## What I Learned

- Different emotions for different cultural contexts (reverence for "thank you")
- Gesture chaining with musical timing creates natural sequences
- Shape morphing adds semantic meaning (sun/moon shapes)

Cultural preservation through interactive technology! üéâ

**3. Ideas Example**

Category: **Ideas** Title: `Example: How to submit feature requests` Body:

````markdown
This is an example of how to submit a feature request! Here's the format we'd
love to see:

---

## Problem

Describe what you're trying to build and what's missing.

_Example: "I'm building a chatbot interface and want the mascot to show
curiosity when the user asks a question."_

## Proposed Solution

Be specific about what you'd like added:

- Visual appearance
- Behavior/animation
- API usage

_Example:_

```javascript
// User asks a question
chatbot.on('question', () => {
    mascot.setEmotion('curious');
    mascot.express('tilt');
});
```

## Alternatives Considered

Show you've thought it through - what else did you try?

## Willing to Contribute?

**4. Performance Example**

Category: **Performance & Optimization** Title:
`Example: Sharing performance benchmarks` Body:

````markdown
This is an example of how to share performance data! Here's the format we'd love
to see:

---

## Desktop Performance

- **Device**: Your device specs
- **Particles**: Number of particles
- **FPS**: Average frame rate
- **CPU**: CPU usage percentage

## Mobile Performance

- **Device**: Your mobile device
- **Particles**: Number (often auto-scaled)
- **FPS**: Average frame rate
- **Battery**: Impact if measured

## Your Configuration

```javascript
const mascot = new EmotiveMascot({
    canvasId: 'canvas',
    adaptiveQuality: true,
    particleCount: isMobile ? 150 : 400,
});
```

## Tips You Discovered

Share any optimization tricks you found!
