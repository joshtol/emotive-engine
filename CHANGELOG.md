### ✨ Public API Enhancements

#### Instant Emotion Transitions

- **Added** duration parameter support to `setEmotion()` method in
  EmotiveMascotPublic
    - Accepts duration as second parameter: `setEmotion('joy', 0)` for instant
      transitions
    - Supports three parameter formats:
        - Undertone string: `setEmotion('joy', 'warm')`
        - Duration number: `setEmotion('joy', 0)` for instant (no particle
          artifacts)
        - Options object:
          `setEmotion('joy', { undertone: 'warm', duration: 0 })`
    - Default transition duration remains 500ms for backwards compatibility

- **Fixed** particle transition artifacts when rapidly switching emotion states
    - Instant transitions (0ms) eliminate errant particles from previous states
    - Particularly useful for card carousels and rapid UI interactions
    - Cherokee language learning demo updated to use instant transitions

#### Documentation

- **Updated** API.md with comprehensive setEmotion() parameter documentation
- **Added** examples for all parameter formats
- **Documented** use case for instant transitions to prevent particle artifacts

## [2.6.0] - 2025-01-14

### 🎯 Rotation & Braking System Overhaul

#### Major Changes

- **CONVERTED** entire rotation system from radians to degrees for simplicity
    - Renderer now uses degrees internally (0-360°)
    - Velocity is measured in degrees per frame (not radians per second)
    - All angle calculations simplified to match standard animation practices

#### Braking System Rewrite

- **REDESIGNED** RotationBrake class for smooth, predictable deceleration
    - Time-based easing using quartic ease-out function (1 - (1-t)^4)
    - Dynamic duration calculation:
      `(angleToTravel / |velocity|) * DURATION_FACTOR * 5`
    - Brake runs within renderer's animation loop (no separate RAF)
    - Automatic target calculation to nearest upright (0°/360°) position
    - Smooth anticipatory deceleration that visually "seeks" the target

#### Demo Improvements

- **UPDATED** rotation slider to use -10 to 10 range (matches velocity units)
- **ADDED** gradient background to rotation slider (blue CCW → green CW)
- **ENHANCED** slider thumb with gradient, shadows, and hover effects
- **SIMPLIFIED** brake button to single-click only (removed double-click)
- **FIXED** slider immediately resets to 0 when brake is pressed

#### Technical Details

- **REMOVED** 200+ lines of complex physics calculations
- **REPLACED** with ~100 lines of simple, working code
- **ELIMINATED** unit conversion bugs between radians/degrees
- **FIXED** race conditions between brake and renderer updates
- **IMPROVED** performance with single animation loop

## [2.5.0] - 2025-01-11

### ✨ Visual Effects & Polish

#### New Features

- **Added** Chromatic aberration effect on impact gestures (bounce, shake,
  pulse, flash, jump, slam, spin, flicker)
    - Subtle red/cyan color separation creating a "glitch" effect
    - CSS-based animation for smooth performance
    - Intensity varies by gesture type (flash/jump = 100%, shake = 90%, bounce =
      80%, etc.)
    - Quick 300-500ms duration for tasteful impact enhancement
- **Renamed** Sparkle effect to Flicker (creates falling star particles)
- **Added** New Sparkle effect with firefly-like glow particles
- **Improved** Star particle shape from 4-pointed to 5-pointed with better
  proportions

#### Technical Improvements

- **Refactored** Special effects to use CSS animations on visible canvas element
- **Fixed** Canvas element targeting for post-processing effects
- **Optimized** Effect update loop with proper fade timing

## [2.4.0] - 2025-01-11

  only:
    - Animation control (play, pause, stop)
    - Gesture/emotion triggers with timestamps
    - Audio loading and analysis
    - Timeline recording/playback

- **Planned** Timeline System for animation recording:
    - Record user interactions with timestamps
    - Export/import animation sequences as JSON
    - Seek/scrub functionality
    - Synchronize with audio playback

- **Planned** Security measures:
    - Hide internal implementation (ShapeMorpher, AudioDeformer)
    - Private modules for core algorithms
    - Non-enumerable internal methods
    - Bundled & minified distribution

- **Planned** Package structure:
    ```
    package.json (private: true)
    src/
      EmotiveMascotPublic.js  (public API)
      EmotiveMascot.js         (internal)
      core/                    (internal modules)
    dist/
      emotive-engine.min.js    (bundled & minified)
      emotive-engine.d.ts      (TypeScript definitions)
    ```
