## [Unreleased]

## [2.6.0] - 2025-01-14

### 🎯 Rotation & Braking System Overhaul

#### Major Changes
- **CONVERTED** entire rotation system from radians to degrees for simplicity
  - Renderer now uses degrees internally (0-360°)
  - Velocity is measured in degrees per frame (not radians per second)
  - All angle calculations simplified to match standard animation practices

#### Braking System Rewrite
- **REDESIGNED** RotationBrake class for smooth, predictable deceleration
  - Time-based easing using quartic ease-out function (1 - (1-t)^4)
  - Dynamic duration calculation: `(angleToTravel / |velocity|) * DURATION_FACTOR * 5`
  - Brake runs within renderer's animation loop (no separate RAF)
  - Automatic target calculation to nearest upright (0°/360°) position
  - Smooth anticipatory deceleration that visually "seeks" the target

#### Demo Improvements
- **UPDATED** rotation slider to use -10 to 10 range (matches velocity units)
- **ADDED** gradient background to rotation slider (blue CCW → green CW)
- **ENHANCED** slider thumb with gradient, shadows, and hover effects
- **SIMPLIFIED** brake button to single-click only (removed double-click)
- **FIXED** slider immediately resets to 0 when brake is pressed

#### Technical Details
- **REMOVED** 200+ lines of complex physics calculations
- **REPLACED** with ~100 lines of simple, working code
- **ELIMINATED** unit conversion bugs between radians/degrees
- **FIXED** race conditions between brake and renderer updates
- **IMPROVED** performance with single animation loop

## [2.5.0] - 2025-01-11

### ✨ Visual Effects & Polish

#### New Features
- **Added** Chromatic aberration effect on impact gestures (bounce, shake, pulse, flash, jump, slam, spin, flicker)
  - Subtle red/cyan color separation creating a "glitch" effect
  - CSS-based animation for smooth performance
  - Intensity varies by gesture type (flash/jump = 100%, shake = 90%, bounce = 80%, etc.)
  - Quick 300-500ms duration for tasteful impact enhancement
  
- **Renamed** Sparkle effect to Flicker (creates falling star particles)
- **Added** New Sparkle effect with firefly-like glow particles
- **Improved** Star particle shape from 4-pointed to 5-pointed with better proportions

#### Technical Improvements
- **Refactored** Special effects to use CSS animations on visible canvas element
- **Fixed** Canvas element targeting for post-processing effects
- **Optimized** Effect update loop with proper fade timing

## [2.4.0] - 2025-01-11
