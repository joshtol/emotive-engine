# Changelog - Emotive Engine Core

All notable changes and innovations to this project are documented in this file with timestamps for IP protection.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.1.0] - 2025-01-09

### üéµ Major Innovation: Musical Time-Based Animation System
- **PATENTABLE**: Invented revolutionary gesture scheduling system that operates in musical time rather than clock time
- **PATENTABLE**: Developed 60,000ms/BPM conversion algorithm for perfect beat synchronization
- **PATENTABLE**: Created hierarchical rhythm modulation system (Gesture ‚Üí Emotion ‚Üí Undertone)
- Implemented `MusicalDuration` class for tempo-adaptive animations
- Built `GestureScheduler` with musical boundary quantization
- Added per-gesture queue management to prevent spam
- Integrated rhythm engine with all gesture types

### ‚ú® Added
- **Rhythm Integration Module** (`src/core/rhythmIntegration.js`)
  - Connects rhythm engine to gesture system
  - Provides tempo and pattern management
  - Handles start/stop/pause functionality
  
- **Musical Duration System** (`src/core/MusicalDuration.js`)
  - Converts between musical time (beats/bars) and milliseconds
  - Supports subdivisions (quarter, eighth, sixteenth notes)
  - Automatic tempo scaling

- **Gesture Scheduler** (`src/core/GestureScheduler.js`)
  - Schedules gestures on musical boundaries (beat/bar/phrase)
  - Queue management with overflow handling
  - Visual feedback callbacks for UI integration

- **Enhanced Gesture Transitions**
  - Smooth entry/exit for scan gesture (15% transition zones)
  - Improved hula gesture with sine-based easing (10% transitions)
  - Fixed orbit gesture center clustering with minimum radius enforcement

### üîß Fixed
- Fixed rhythmEngine property access (getBPM() ‚Üí .bpm)
- Removed debug code that was changing particle colors
- Fixed gesture transitions for scan, hula, and orbit
- Corrected FPS counter implementation

### üìù Documentation
- Created comprehensive defensive publication (2025-01-09)
- Added detailed BPM conversion formula explanation
- Documented rhythm configuration for all gestures

## [2.0.0] - 2025-01-08

### üß† Major Innovation: Emotion-Driven Particle System
- **PATENTABLE**: Created emotion matrix with behavioral undertones
- Developed 40+ unique gesture animations
- Implemented particle physics with emotional responsiveness
- Built modular gesture system with hot-swapping capability

### ‚ú® Added
- **Core Emotion System**
  - 12 primary emotions (neutral, joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, disgust, love, euphoria, excited, suspicion, resting)
  - 6 behavioral undertones (nervous, intense, tired, confident, subdued)
  - Emotion-gesture mapping system

- **Gesture Categories**
  - Motion gestures (bounce, pulse, shake, spin, etc.)
  - Transform gestures (expand, contract, morph, etc.)
  - Effects gestures (flash, glow, flicker, etc.)
  - Complex gestures (scan, hula, orbit with 3D depth)

- **Particle System**
  - Dynamic particle count based on emotion
  - Velocity and acceleration modulation
  - Color and glow effects per emotion
  - Z-coordinate system for 3D depth

### üé® UI/UX
- Sci-fi themed demo interface
- Light/Dark/Night theme system
- Real-time FPS counter
- Gesture button visual feedback

## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-07

### üöÄ Initial Release
- Basic particle engine with canvas rendering
- Simple emotion states
- Foundation for gesture system
- Basic orbital and wave animations
