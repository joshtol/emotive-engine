## Security Measures

Emotive Engine implements multiple security layers:

### Code Security

- **Input Validation**: All configuration parameters are validated and sanitized
- **Output Encoding**: Canvas rendering prevents injection attacks
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability checks via npm audit
- **Secure Defaults**: All dangerous features disabled by default

### Runtime Security

- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Compatible with strict CSP policies
- **Sandboxing**: Isolated execution context
- **Memory Safety**: Object pooling prevents memory exhaustion
- **Error Handling**: Sensitive information never exposed in error messages

### Build Security

- **Supply Chain**: Dependencies pinned to specific versions
- **Build Reproducibility**: Deterministic builds with checksums
- **Code Signing**: Releases signed with GPG key (coming soon)
- **SBOM**: Software Bill of Materials available (coming soon)

### Monitoring

- **Sentry Integration**: Optional error tracking (user-configured)
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in performance APIs
- **Audit Logging**: Available through custom event handlers

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Secure Configuration

```javascript
// ✅ Good: Minimal privilege configuration
const mascot = new EmotiveMascot({
    canvasId: 'safe-canvas',
    emotion: 'neutral',
    performanceMode: 'balanced',
    sentry: {
        enabled: true,
        dsn: 'YOUR_SENTRY_DSN',
        environment: 'production',
    },
});

// ❌ Bad: Accepting untrusted user input
const emotion = getUserInput(); // NEVER DO THIS
mascot.setEmotion(emotion); // Could be malicious
```

### Input Validation

Always validate user input before passing to Emotive Engine:

```javascript
// ✅ Whitelist approach
const ALLOWED_EMOTIONS = ['joy', 'neutral', 'calm', 'excited'];

function setUserEmotion(userInput) {
    if (ALLOWED_EMOTIONS.includes(userInput)) {
        mascot.setEmotion(userInput);
    } else {
        console.warn('Invalid emotion rejected:', userInput);
    }
}
```

### Content Security Policy

Emotive Engine is compatible with strict CSP. Recommended policy:

```html
<meta
    http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
    content="default-src 'self';
               script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval';
               worker-src 'self' blob:;
               connect-src 'self' https://sentry.io;"
/>
```

Note: `unsafe-eval` is required for dynamic gesture loading (optional feature).

### Dependency Security

Regularly audit your dependencies:

```bash
npm audit
npm audit fix
```

Monitor for updates:

```bash
npm outdated
```

## Known Security Considerations

### Canvas Fingerprinting

Emotive Engine uses HTML5 Canvas, which can theoretically be used for browser
fingerprinting. This is an inherent property of Canvas APIs and not specific to
our implementation.

**Mitigation**: If privacy is critical, consider:

- Using privacy-focused browsers with canvas fingerprinting protection
- Implementing canvas noise injection (browser extensions)
- Limiting mascot deployment to authenticated users only

### Third-Party Dependencies

We minimize dependencies but include:

- `@sentry/browser` (error tracking)
- `@babel/runtime` (polyfills)

All dependencies are:

- Regularly audited for vulnerabilities
- Pinned to specific versions
- Reviewed before updates

### Performance-Based Side Channels

Timing attacks based on animation performance are theoretically possible but
have minimal practical risk for typical use cases.
