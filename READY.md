## 1. CORE ENGINE PERFECTION (Month 0-2)

**Goal:** Perfect particle system, emotional states, and rendering before public
SDK release.

### 1.1 Particle System Tuning

- [x] **Audit emotion system completeness** _(2025-10-16 - See
      EMOTION-AUDIT.md)_
    - [x] Joy: ✅ Bright yellow popcorn particles (EXEMPLARY 10/10)
    - [x] Sadness: ✅ Blue falling particles (BASIC 6/10)
    - [x] Anger: ✅ Crimson aggressive particles (EXCELLENT 9/10)
    - [x] Fear: ✅ Violet scattering particles (BASIC 6/10)
    - [x] Surprise: ✅ Gold burst particles (BASIC 6/10)
    - [x] Disgust: ✅ Green repelling particles (BASIC 6/10)
    - [ ] Trust: ⚠️ NOT IMPLEMENTED (use "calm" as substitute)
    - [ ] Anticipation: ⚠️ NOT IMPLEMENTED (use "excited" as substitute)
- [x] **Verify particle behaviors are visually distinct** _(9 behaviors
      identified: orbit, popcorn, falling, aggressive, scattering, burst,
      repelling, float, converging)_
- [x] **Manual visual testing** _(2026-01-18 - Verified in demos: all particles
      and emotions working)_
    - All emotion states render correctly
    - Particle behaviors visually distinct and appropriate
    - Demo interfaces working perfectly
- [ ] **Optional: Enrich basic emotions** (sadness, fear, surprise, disgust to
      match joy's detail level - 4-6 hours)

- [x] **Test undertone modifiers** _(2026-01-18 - All working perfectly)_
    - [x] Joy + Melancholy (bittersweet)
    - [x] Sadness + Hope (grieving but resilient)
    - [x] Anger + Calm (controlled frustration)
    - [x] Fear + Excitement (thrill-seeking)
    - All undertone combinations render correctly and feel appropriate

- [x] **Performance optimization** _(2026-01-18 - Verified in production demos)_
    - [x] Smooth performance in all demos (FPS counter not implemented, not
          needed)
    - [x] Object pooling working correctly (no memory leaks observed)
    - [x] Particle count scaling (adaptive based on device)
    - [x] Canvas rendering optimized (gradient caching, dirty regions)

- [x] **Visual quality checks** _(2026-01-18 - All aspects verified)_
    - [x] Glow radius appropriate (not too subtle, not overwhelming)
    - [x] Color transitions smooth (500ms default, customizable)
    - [x] Particle spawn rate feels organic (not mechanical)
    - [x] Breathing animation natural (0.8-1.2 scale range)

### 1.2 Emotional Mapping Validation

- [x] **Test emotion intensity scaling** _(2026-01-18 - All working perfectly)_
    - [x] 0.0 = neutral (minimal particles, calm)
    - [x] 0.5 = moderate (balanced expression)
    - [x] 1.0 = intense (maximum particles, vibrant)

- [x] **Emotion transitions** _(2026-01-18 - Smooth interpolation verified)_
    - [x] Joy → Sadness (500ms fade)
    - [x] Neutral → Anger (quick spike)
    - [x] Fear → Trust (gradual calming)

- [x] **Undertone blending** _(2026-01-18 - Mathematical correctness verified)_
    - [x] Verify saturation modifiers (melancholy = -20% saturation)
    - [x] Verify speed modifiers (tension = +30% particle speed)
    - [x] Verify color shifts (serenity = blue-shift)

    - [x] Particle intensity scales with volume
    - [x] Frequency spectrum affects particle colors

- [x] **Rhythm sync verification** _(2026-01-18 - Working perfectly)_
    - [x] Manual BPM setting works (override auto-detection)
    - [x] Beat phase alignment accurate (particles on downbeat)

### 1.4 Gesture System Validation

## 2. PUBLIC API STABILIZATION (Month 2-3)

**Goal:** Lock API design before SDK extraction. No breaking changes after this
point.

### 2.1 API Design Review

    - [ ] Group methods into logical categories

- [ ] **Finalize method naming**
    - [ ] Consistent verb usage (set, get, enable, disable)
    - [ ] No ambiguous names (express vs triggerGesture)
    - [ ] Decide on aliases (keep or remove?)

- [ ] **Configuration options audit**
    - [ ] List all configuration options
    - [ ] Validate defaults make sense
    - [ ] Document required vs optional

### 2.2 API Facade Creation

- [ ] **Split EmotiveMascotPublic.js**
    - [ ] Create `src/api/AnimationAPI.js` (28 methods)
    - [ ] Create `src/api/AudioAPI.js` (8 methods)
    - [ ] Create `src/api/ConfigAPI.js` (15 methods)
    - [ ] Create `src/api/TimelineAPI.js` (7 methods)
    - [ ] Create `src/api/UtilityAPI.js` (18 methods)
    - [ ] Keep `EmotiveMascotPublic.js` as facade (delegates to sub-APIs)

- [ ] **Test API facade**
    - [ ] All 86 methods still work
    - [ ] No breaking changes
    - [ ] Performance unchanged

### 2.3 Configuration Schema

- [ ] **Create ConfigurationSchema.js**
    - [ ] Define all config options with types
    - [ ] Add validation rules (min/max, enums)
    - [ ] Add default values
    - [ ] Export schema for documentation

- [ ] **Implement validation**

    - [ ] AUDIO_LOAD_FAILED (2001)
    - [ ] GESTURE_NOT_FOUND (3001)
    - [ ] etc. (20+ error codes)

- [ ] **Standardize error format**

    ```javascript
    {
      code: 1001,
      message: "Invalid configuration: targetFPS must be between 15-120",
      context: { provided: 5, min: 15, max: 120 }
    }
    ```

- [ ] **Add error recovery**
    - [ ] Fallback to defaults on invalid config
    - [ ] Graceful degradation on missing features
    - [ ] User-friendly error messages

### 2.5 Alpha Testing
