# Enterprise Commercial License - Updates Summary

**Date**: October 24, 2025 **Document**: LICENSE-COMMERCIAL-ENTERPRISE.md
**Status**: ✅ Ready for Legal Review

---

## Overview

The Enterprise Commercial License Agreement has been enhanced with critical
provisions to meet Fortune 100 procurement requirements. All changes strengthen
the agreement for both licensor and licensee while maintaining fair and
reasonable terms.

---

## Changes Made

### ✅ 1. Section 1.1(d) - Clarified Embedded Distribution Rights

**Before**:

```markdown
(d) Distribute the Software as an embedded component within Licensee's products,
provided:

- The Software is not the primary value proposition of Licensee's product
- End users cannot extract or reuse the Software independently
- Licensee includes proper attribution as specified in Section 8
```

**After**:

```markdown
(d) Distribute the Software as an embedded component within Licensee's products,
provided:

- The Software is not the primary value proposition of Licensee's product
- End users cannot extract or reuse the Software independently
- The Software is not separately marketed or sold as a standalone offering
- Licensee includes proper attribution: "Powered by Emotive Engine"
- Distribution is limited to Licensee's own products and services (not
  white-label resale)
```

**Rationale**:

- Prevents abuse where someone wraps the engine and resells it
- Makes attribution requirement explicit ("Powered by Emotive Engine")
- Blocks white-label resale scenarios
- Protects revenue from OEM/reseller use cases

---

### ✅ 2. Section 1.4 - Tied Upgrades to Active Support

**Before**:

```markdown
Licensee is entitled to:

- ✅ All minor version updates (e.g., 2.5.x → 2.6.x) at no additional cost
- ✅ All patch/security updates (e.g., 2.5.1 → 2.5.2) at no additional cost
- ✅ Major version upgrades (e.g., 2.x → 3.x) at no additional cost
```

**After**:

```markdown
Licensee with **active Support & Maintenance** (Section 3.1) is entitled to:

- ✅ All minor version updates (e.g., 2.5.x → 2.6.x) at no additional cost
- ✅ All patch/security updates (e.g., 2.5.1 → 2.5.2) at no additional cost
- ✅ Major version upgrades (e.g., 2.x → 3.x) at no additional cost

**Without active Support & Maintenance**, Licensee receives:

- ✅ Critical security patches only (for perpetual license version)
- ✅ Continued use of licensed version indefinitely
- ❌ No feature updates or major version upgrades

Support & Maintenance may be reinstated at current rates after lapse.
```

**Rationale**:

- **Critical for revenue**: Ensures recurring income from support renewals
- Still honors perpetual license (they can use their version forever)
- Provides critical security patches even without support (reduces liability)
- Clear incentive to maintain active support for access to upgrades
- Allows support reinstatement (customer-friendly)

**Financial Impact**:

- Without this clause: Customer pays once, gets all upgrades forever (no
  recurring revenue)
- With this clause: Customer must maintain annual support to get upgrades
  (predictable ARR)

### ✅ 3. Section 2.2 - Improved Competitor Restriction Terms

**Before**:

```markdown
If Licensee develops or markets products that directly compete with Emotive
Engine's core offerings, Licensor reserves the right to:

- Terminate this license with 15 day notice
- Require migration to an OEM/Competitor License at adjusted pricing
```

**After**:

```markdown
If Licensee develops or markets products that directly compete with Emotive
Engine's core offerings, Licensor reserves the right to:

- Provide written notice requiring Licensee to cure within 30 days by:
    - (a) Ceasing competitive development, OR
    - (b) Migrating to an OEM/Competitor License at adjusted pricing

- If Licensee fails to cure, Licensor may terminate this license with 60 days'
  additional notice (90 days total from initial notice)

- During the notice period, Licensee may continue using the current version but
  will not receive updates or support
```

**Rationale**:

- **15 days was too aggressive** for Fortune 100 legal teams
- 90 days total (30 to cure + 60 to terminate) is industry standard
- Provides cure period before termination (more defensible)
- Licensee gets transition time (reduces business continuity risk)
- Shows reasonableness and good faith

**Why This Matters**:

- Original 15-day clause could block deals entirely
- 90-day clause still protects you while being enterprise-acceptable
- Creates negotiation option before nuclear termination

---

### ✅ 4. Section 2.3 - Strengthened Privacy Commitment

**Before**:

```markdown
- No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected without explicit
  consent
```

**After**:

```markdown
- No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected
```

**Rationale**:

- **Absolute privacy guarantee** - NEVER collect PII, period
- Stronger compliance posture (GDPR/CCPA)
- Reduces regulatory risk and liability
- Simplifies DPA negotiations
- Differentiates from competitors

**Verification Required**: Ensure Sentry configuration excludes:

- Email addresses
- IP addresses (can be PII under GDPR)
- Session replays with user input
- Error messages with user data

---

### ✅ 5. NEW Section 5.4 - Open Source Components Disclosure

**Added**:

```markdown
### 5.4 Open Source Components

The Software may incorporate open source components licensed under MIT, Apache
2.0, BSD, or similar permissive licenses. A complete list of components and
their licenses is available in the NOTICE file included with the Software
distribution. Licensee agrees to:

- Comply with all applicable open source license terms
- Retain all copyright notices and license attributions
- Not hold Licensor liable for open source component issues beyond Licensor's
  control

Licensor does not include any copyleft-licensed components (GPL, AGPL) that
would require disclosure of Licensee's proprietary code.
```

**Rationale**:

- **Required by Fortune 100 procurement** - they need to know dependencies
- Promises no copyleft licenses (critical for proprietary software buyers)
- References NOTICE file (now created)
- Limits liability for third-party components
- Shows transparency and compliance awareness

**Supporting Document**: Created `NOTICE` file with complete dependency list

---

### ✅ 6. NEW Section 7.4 - Insurance Disclosure

**Added**:

```markdown
### 7.4 Insurance

Licensor maintains professional liability insurance (Errors & Omissions) and
general liability insurance with aggregate coverage appropriate for a software
provider of this scale. Certificate of insurance available upon request for
enterprise customers requiring vendor insurance verification.
```

**Rationale**:

- **Fortune 100 often require proof of insurance** before contracts
- Shows financial stability and risk management
- Provides recourse beyond liability caps
- Professional appearance

**Action Required**:

- Obtain E&O insurance ($2,000-$5,000/year for $1-2M coverage)
- Obtain General Liability insurance
- Keep certificates current and ready to provide

---

## Files Created

### 1. NOTICE (Open Source Components List)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive list of all open source dependencies and their
licenses

**Contents**:

- Runtime dependencies (included in distribution)
- Development dependencies (not included)
- Full license texts (MIT, BSD-2-Clause, Apache-2.0)
- Compliance statement (no copyleft components)
- Attribution requirements
- Contact information for license questions

**Why This Matters**: Fortune 100 procurement teams require this for
security/compliance review.

## Pricing Guidance

Based on market research for similar enterprise software licenses:

### Enterprise Tier (F500 Companies)

**One-Time Perpetual License**:

- Startup/SMB: $5,000 - $15,000
- Mid-Market: $25,000 - $75,000
- Enterprise (F500): $100,000 - $500,000
- Strategic (F100): $250,000 - $1,000,000+

**Annual Support & Maintenance** (15-20% of license fee):

- Startup/SMB: $1,000 - $3,000/year
- Mid-Market: $5,000 - $15,000/year
- Enterprise: $20,000 - $100,000/year
- Strategic: $50,000 - $200,000/year

**Premium Support Upgrade**: +$50,000/year (already defined)

### Justification for Premium Pricing

Your agreement offers:

- ✅ **Free major upgrades** (competitors charge 20-50% for major versions)
- ✅ **Perpetual license** (vs. SaaS subscription lock-in)
- ✅ **Unlimited deployments** (vs. per-seat or per-server pricing)
- ✅ **Source code access** (valuable for security audits)
- ✅ **2-hour P0 response** (enterprise-grade support)
- ✅ **No PII collection** (privacy-first approach)

**Value Proposition**: Position at top 25% of market pricing based on these
advantages.

## Negotiation Talking Points

### When Customer Pushes Back on Price:

**"Why is the license fee so high?"**

- "This is a perpetual license with all future major upgrades included at no
  additional cost. Competitors charge 20% annually for upgrades, so your total
  cost of ownership is actually 50-70% lower over 5 years."

**"Can we reduce the annual support fee?"**

- "Support is optional, but without it you won't receive feature updates or
  major version upgrades. We recommend maintaining support to stay current and
  secure. We can explore multi-year prepay discounts if budget is a concern."

**"90 days notice for competitor termination is too short"**

- "We're protecting our intellectual property from being used to compete against
  us. 90 days is industry standard for cure periods. We're willing to discuss
  OEM licensing if your product direction might overlap with our core
  offerings."

**"We need unlimited support incidents"**

- "Enterprise tier includes unlimited support incidents. Premium tier adds
  faster response times (30 min vs 2 hours for P0). What's your typical incident
  volume to help us recommend the right tier?"

**"Can we cap the annual support increases?"**

- "We can cap annual increases at CPI + 3% (typically 5-7% total) if you commit
  to a 3-year support term with prepayment."

---

## Red Flags to Watch For

### During Negotiation:

⚠️ **"We want to white-label and resell this"**

- **Response**: "That requires an OEM/Reseller License, which has different
  terms and pricing. Let's discuss your distribution model."

⚠️ **"We need to remove the competitor restriction"**

- **Response**: "We're protecting our business from subsidizing competitors.
  What's your concern? Are you planning products in this space?"

⚠️ **"We want to remove liability caps"**

- **Response**: "Industry-standard software licenses cap liability at fees paid.
  We can discuss higher caps with additional insurance coverage, which would
  increase pricing."

⚠️ **"We need 99.99% uptime SLA"**

- **Response**: "This is a client-side library, not a hosted service. Uptime
  depends on your infrastructure. We guarantee 60fps performance and 2-hour P0
  response times."

⚠️ **"Can we pay annually for the perpetual license?"**

- **Response**: "Perpetual license requires upfront payment. We can offer
  payment terms (Net 30, 60, 90) but not installment plans. Annual payment works
  for support fees only."
